Implementation in Matlab of Lucas-Kanade 2D Image Registration to construct motion fields between consecutive frames of a video. The Lucas-Kanade method is weighted and applied iteratively at each level of the Gaussian pyramids of the two consecutive images to produce a more refined motion field. demo_optical_flow.m, quiver_overlay_sequences.m, and all images were provided by Kaleem Siddiqi and Michael Langer.
